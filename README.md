## About

My assignment was to create a card game that would be playable through the terminal. You will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards.

# FlashCards 

## Fork This Repo

On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install

Run node index.js from the root directory in your terminal:

The game will begin

## Project Goals

* Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Implement DRY code and follow the SRP.
* Demonstrate good GitHub workflow.

## Challenges

* Getting accustomed to tests suite syntax
* Knowing whether the testing suite is robust enough

## Wins

* The game is completely playable
* Additional practice writing tests using the expect assertion library

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* terminal

## In Action
